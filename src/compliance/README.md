# Decentralized Compliance Validation

Decentralized / Distributed Ledger based compliance validation is currently in experimental mode.

## How it might work
1. Each one who wants to make a transaction (including making a post) needs to stake a small amount of ETH
2. If this transaction is not "downvoted" by the majority of voters within 2 hours, the author of the transaction receives his stake back
3. The ones who want to vote also stake a small amount of ETH. They receive back their stake + a small reward if they voted correctly - meaning in favor of the majority decision - so anyone has an incentive to go with the flow and behave in a fair and reasonable way.
