# Security

## Protect your Private Key
Ensure that your private key - which you might enter in the private .env file to use specific features of this package - always stays private. To do so please ensure the .env file is never commited / pushed to your remote repository (see .gigignore) and also check the code of this package and its dependencies. The more reasonable people check this on a regular basis, the more secure this package can be. 

## Report potential Security Vulnerabilities
If you found a potential security vulnerability, please raise a general issue **without revealing the vulnerability itself**. Just mention that you want to get in touch regarding a potential security vulnerability and let us know how we can contact you.

## Protect your Project
In order to protect your project from potentially questionable dependencies of dependencies of dependencies ... we recommend to take a look at [this issue](https://github.com/michael-spengler/decentralized-finance/issues/2) describing the general postinstall exploit.

## Independent Audits
We did not trigger any audits yet. The plan is to do so as soon as this package has a strong adoption and contributor base.
We will then trigger audits via [Zeppelin Solutions](https://zeppelin.solutions/) and publish the Zeppelin Solutions Audit Report.
