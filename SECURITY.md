# Security

## Independent Audits
We did not trigger any audits yet. The plan is to do so as soon as this package has a strong adoption and contributor base.
We will then trigger audits via [Zeppelin Solutions](https://zeppelin.solutions/) and publish the Zeppelin Solutions Audit Report.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
The discrete disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security of our users.

### How to report a security vulnerability?
If you believe youâ€™ve found a security vulnerability in our code, please raise a general issue **without revealing the vulnerability itself**. Just mention that you want to get in touch regarding a potential security vulnerability and let us know how we can contact you.

## Protect your Project
